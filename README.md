We assess the drivers and the spatial distribution of influenza among low SES populations in the United States. First, we generated a social contact network that incorporates contact heterogeneity
by socioeconomic status. These files can be found in the Network Model folder. We then simulated influenza transmission, incorporating major hypotheses for differences in influenza transmission by socioeconomic status. 
These files can be found in the Epidemiological Model folder. Lastly, we used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the spatial distribution of low SES influenza. 
These files can be found in the Statistical Model folder.
